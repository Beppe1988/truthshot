# Download

You can download Libre Camera on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) by tapping on the badge below. Alternatively, download and install the apk directly from the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/releases) page. Downloading directly from the GitHub releases page will typically download a more recent version – notice though that the F-Droid and the GitHub versions aren't compatible with one another. You will need to reinstall the app; make sure you remember your settings.

# Contributing

## Translate

Languages currently supported: 
  - **English**
  - **French (Français)** – *thanks to [@melentan](https://github.com/melentan)*
  - **German (Deutsch)**
  - **Japanese (日本語)** – *thanks to [@vladkorotnev](https://github.com/vladkorotnev)*
  - **Spanish (Español)** – *thanks to [@Loughty](https://github.com/Loughty)*
  - **Basque (Euskara)** – *thanks to [@ZiTAL](https://github.com/ZiTAL)*
  - **Portuguese (Português)** – *thanks to [@zehrique](https://github.com/zehrique)*
  - **Russian (Русский)** – *thanks to [@vladkorotnev](https://github.com/vladkorotnev)*
  - **Turkish (Türkçe)** – *thanks to [@metezd](https://github.com/metezd)*

*Get started:*

1. If not already supported (see above), request a new language by [opening an issue](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/issues) on GitHub and I will add the necessary code for the second step
2. Translate an already existing language (see below)

**Translating guide:** Go to the .arb file of the language you want to translate (for example, [app_de.arb](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/blob/master/assets/l10n/app_de.arb) file for German) and change the text inside the "" quotation marks. If the keys listed in the [untranslatedMessages.txt](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/blob/master/untranslatedMessages.txt) don't exist, simply create them just like the others. Use the [English](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/blob/master/assets/l10n/app_en.arb) translation as a reference for the text to be translated to the target language.

Additionally, if you want to translate the local app name (default: "Libre Camera"), go to the strings.xml file of the language you want to translate (for example, [this](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/blob/master/android/app/src/main/res/values-de/styles.xml) file for German and translate the "Libre Camera" text inside the string elements, like this German translation: ```<string name="AppName">Libre Kamera</string>```

Send in your translated files as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/pulls)

## Code

Feel free to send in a [pull request](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/pulls)! To get started with Flutter, follow this link: [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

1. Clone this repository
2. Switch to the project's directory and run `flutter pub get`. To test the app, run the project in debug mode by selecting an Android device or emulator in your preferred Flutter IDE and running the app in debug mode
3. To build the final app, run the app by installing the apk (see next) on an Android device or emulator. To receive the apk, run the following command in your terminal: `flutter build apk` – the output apk will be generated at`librecamera/build/app/outputs/apk/release/`. If you'd like to get multiple apks by splitting them into different platforms (results in smaller sizes) use `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`

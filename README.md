# Contributing

-  ### Translate

Currently supported languages: 
  - **English** ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
  - **German** ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
  - **Japanese** ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ (special thanks to [@vladkorotnev](https://github.com/vladkorotnev))
  - **Spanish** ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ (special thanks to [@Loughty](https://github.com/Loughty))
  - **Portuguese** ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· (special thanks to [@zehrique](https://github.com/zehrique))
  - **Russian** ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º (special thanks to [@vladkorotnev](https://github.com/vladkorotnev))

*Get started:*

1. If not already supported (see above), request a new language by [opening an issue](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/issues) on GitHub and I will add the necessary code for the second step
2. Translate an already existing language (see below)

Translating guide: Go to the .arb file of the language you want to translate (for example, [this](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/blob/master/assets/l10n/app_de.arb) file for German) and change the text inside the "" quotation marks. Use the [English](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/blob/master/assets/l10n/app_en.arb) translation as a reference for the text to be translated to the target language.

Additionally, if you want to translate the local app name (default: "Libre Camera"), go to the strings.xml file of the language you want to translate (for example, [this](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/blob/master/android/app/src/main/res/values-de/styles.xml) file for German and translate the "Libre Camera" text inside the string elements, like this German translation: ```<string name="AppName">Libre Kamera</string>```

Send in your translated files as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/pulls)

- ### Bug Reporting or a Feature Request

Open an issue on GitHub: [Open issue](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/issues)

- ### Code

Feel free to send in a [Pull Request](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/pulls)! To get started with Flutter, follow this link: [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

1. Clone this repository
2. Switch to the project's directory and run the project in debug mode by selecting an Android device or emulator in your preferred Flutter IDE and running the app in debug mode
3. To test the final app, run the app by installing the apk on an Android device or emulator. To get the apk, run the following command in your terminal: ```flutter build apk --split-per-abi``` â€“ the output apk's will be generated at ```librecamera/build/app/outputs/apk/release/```. If you want only one apk without splitting the platforms (results in slightly bigger size) use ```flutter build apk```
